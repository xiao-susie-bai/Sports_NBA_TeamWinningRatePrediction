# Sports Analytics: NBA Team Winning Percentage Rate Prediction using Player Stats, Teams & Year Effects

The NBA history is something about team victory with everyone's contribution to the sweat and tears once shed on the court. For this fanatical topic in the sports analytics domain, we are curious about how each major player’s performance and other relevant factors may influence a team’s winning percentage rate in a season. 

Without doubt, star players’ performances impose a significant influence on the winning rate. Individual players impact game results by various metrics including points, rebounds, assists and turnovers, and the list just goes on. Besides that, some teams might just have performed well or poorly during certain years or periods of time due to the lineup, play style or conponents' competitiveness. These all attract hundreds of thousands of audience to watch the games every season.

In this project, we use both exploratory data analysis / data visualization and statistical modeling (including mixed and fixed effect Panel OLS Regression models) to study the influence of player performance statistics, team and year effects on the team's winning percentage rate in the current season. A few useful insights are drawn from the results.

Our primary data resource is from the ESPN website (https://www.espn.com/nba/standings/) for every team’s winning rate by every season after 2001, as well as from Kaggle (https://www.kaggle.com/lancharro5/seasons-stats-50-19) for all players statistics yearly from 1950 to 2019. The Kaggle dataset has over 26000 observations with 50 variables mainly about player performance, including 2-point field goals, 3-point field goals, free throws, and other features like whether one is defensive player of the year/rookie of the year/Sixth man of the year. We completed data collection, integration and cleaning with R and Excel in the process to prepare the data.
